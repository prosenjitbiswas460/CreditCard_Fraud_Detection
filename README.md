# CreditCard_Fraud_Detection
This repo consists of a python notebook that demonstrates how to predict fraud transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. The data is from a Kaggle dataset 'Credit Card Fraud Detection'.
The data states that the features are scaled and anonymized for security reasons. The techniques used in the notebook for dealing with imbalance are:
1. Undersampling
2. Oversampling through SMOTE

The algorithms used are:
1. LogisiticRegression
2. KNearest
3. Support Vector Classifier
4. DecisionTreeClassifier
5. Deep Neural Network through Keras.
